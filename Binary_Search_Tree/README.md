Binary Search Tree implemented in C++. The program reads from ```input.txt``` to build up the word tree. ```input.txt``` can only contain alphabetic characters and all text must be added to the first line in the text file. The program then reads from ```queries.txt``` file to determine what queries it will be performing. Each line will contain either ```F <string>``` where the "F" denotes a "find" query and the program will then attempt to find ```<string>``` in the word tree, or it will contain ```C <int>``` where the "C" denotes a "count" query and the program will display any word from the word tree that has ```<int>``` or more occurences. ```queries.txt``` must be used with the structure ```F <string>``` or ```C <int>```. There can only be one query per line.  Both files come pre-built with sample text but can be modified afterwards. Files must be named "input.txt" and "queries.txt". 
  
Compile the program using ```g++ source.cpp wordtree.cpp``` and then run the executable that was generated.
